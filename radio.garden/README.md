this website didn't have genre, country or language playlists so scraping it resulted in more than 8000 different playlists, this is why everything has been put to folders

the `null.m3u` file is basically all the streams that didn't have any location data in them in the website's database

i decided not to include a dedicated repo to listen to these playlists but i'm not against the idea either, if you need it, create an issue or discussion and let me know

the links scraped from this website will not be included in my `everything-repo` files and `+merged+` `+checked+` folders either since it would dilute them due no genre, country or language provided
